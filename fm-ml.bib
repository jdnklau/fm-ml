The discrete event systems framework is useful in both software, automation and manufacturing, as problems from those domains can be modelled as discrete supervisory control problems. As a formal framework, DES is also similar to domains for which the field of formal methods for computer science has developed techniques and tools. In this paper, we attempt to marry the two by adapting PDR to the problem of controller synthesis. The resulting algorithm takes as input a transition system with forbidden states and uncontrollable transitions, and synthesises a safe and minimally-restrictive controller, correct-by-design. We also present an implementation along with experimental results, showing that the algorithm has potential as a part of the solution to the greater effort of formal supervisory controller synthesis and verification.},

  abstract      = {We present the first model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to synthesise policies for an unknown Markov Decision Process (MDP), such that a linear time property is satisfied. The given temporal property is converted into a Limit Deterministic Buchi Automaton (LDBA) and a robust reward function is defined over the state-action pairs of the MDP according to the resulting LDBA. With this reward function, the policy synthesis procedure is "constrained" by the given specification. These constraints guide the MDP exploration so as to minimize the solution time by only considering the portion of the MDP that is relevant to satisfaction of the LTL property. This improves performance and scalability of the proposed method by avoiding an exhaustive update over the whole state space while the efficiency of standard methods such as dynamic programming is hindered by excessive memory requirements, caused by the need to store a full-model in memory. Additionally, we show that the RL procedure sets up a local value iteration method to efficiently calculate the maximum probability of satisfying the given property, at any given state of the MDP. We prove that our algorithm is guaranteed to find a policy whose traces probabilistically satisfy the LTL property if such a policy exists, and additionally we show that our method produces reasonable control policies even when the LTL property cannot be satisfied. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated via a set of numerical examples. We observe an improvement of one order of magnitude in the number of iterations required for the synthesis compared to existing approaches.},

  abstract      = {Context: The software development industry is rapidly adopting machine learning for transitioning modern day software systems towards highly intelligent and self-learning systems. However, the full potential of machine learning for improving the software engineering life cycle itself is yet to be discovered, i.e., up to what extent machine learning can help reducing the effort/complexity of software engineering and improving the quality of resulting software systems. To date, no comprehensive study exists that explores the current state-of-the-art on the adoption of machine learning across software engineering life cycle stages. Objective: This article addresses the aforementioned problem and aims to present a state-of-the-art on the growing number of uses of machine learning in software engineering. Method: We conduct a systematic mapping study on applications of machine learning to software engineering following the standard guidelines and principles of empirical software engineering. Results: This study introduces a machine learning for software engineering (MLSE) taxonomy classifying the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques according to their applicability to various software engineering life cycle stages. Overall, 227 articles were rigorously selected and analyzed as a result of this study. Conclusion: From the selected articles, we explore a variety of aspects that should be helpful to academics and practitioners alike in understanding the potential of adopting machine learning techniques during software engineering projects.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents the Neural Network Verification (NNV) software tool, a set-based verification framework for deep neural networks (DNNs) and learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS). The crux of NNV is a collection of reachability algorithms that make use of a variety of set representations, such as polyhedra, star sets, zonotopes, and abstract-domain representations. NNV supports both exact (sound and complete) and over-approximate (sound) reachability algorithms for verifying safety and robustness properties of feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) with various activation functions. For learning-enabled CPS, such as closed-loop control systems incorporating neural networks, NNV provides exact and over-approximate reachability analysis schemes for linear plant models and FFNN controllers with piecewise-linear activation functions, such as ReLUs. For similar neural network control systems (NNCS) that instead have nonlinear plant models, NNV supports over-approximate analysis by combining the star set analysis used for FFNN controllers with zonotope-based analysis for nonlinear plant dynamics building on CORA. We evaluate NNV using two real-world case studies: the first is safety verification of ACAS Xu networks and the second deals with the safety verification of a deep learning-based adaptive cruise control system.},

  month         = apr,
  abstract      = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have redefined the state-of-the-art in many real-world applications, such as facial recognition, image classification, human pose estimation, and semantic segmentation. Despite their success, CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where slight changes to their inputs may lead to sharp changes in their output in even well-trained networks. Set-based analysis methods can detect or prove the absence of bounded adversarial attacks, which can then be used to evaluate the effectiveness of neural network training methodology. Unfortunately, existing verification approaches have limited scalability in terms of the size of networks that can be analyzed. In this paper, we describe a set-based framework that successfully deals with real-world CNNs, such as VGG16 and VGG19, that have high accuracy on ImageNet. Our approach is based on a new set representation called the ImageStar, which enables efficient exact and over-approximative analysis of CNNs. ImageStars perform efficient set-based analysis by combining operations on concrete images with linear programming (LP). Our approach is implemented in a tool called NNV, and can verify the robustness of VGG networks with respect to a small set of input states, derived from adversarial attacks, such as the DeepFool attack. The experimental results show that our approach is less conservative and faster than existing zonotope methods, such as those used in DeepZ, and the polytope method used in DeepPoly.},

We provide a definition of robustness that is general enough to capture different formulations.

Research to address these concerns is particularly active, with a significant number of papers released in the past few years. This survey paper conducts a review of the current research effort into making DNNs safe and trustworthy, by focusing on four aspects: verification, testing, adversarial attack and defence, and interpretability.

We study a generic reachability problem for feed-forward DNNs which, for a given set of inputs to the network and a Lipschitz-continuous function over its outputs, computes the lower and upper bound on the function values. Because the network and the function are Lipschitz continuous, all values in the interval between the lower and upper bound are reachable. We show how to obtain the safety verification problem, the output range analysis problem and a robustness measure by instantiating the reachability problem. We present a novel algorithm based on adaptive nested optimisation to solve the reachability problem. The technique has been implemented and evaluated on a range of DNNs, demonstrating its efficiency, scalability and ability to handle a broader class of networks than state-of-the-art verification approaches.},

As such feedforward networks are memoryless, they can be abstractly represented as mathematical functions, and the reachability analysis of the neural network amounts to interval analysis problems. In the framework of interval analysis, a computationally efficient formula which can quickly compute the output interval sets of a neural network is developed. Then, a specification-guided reachability algorithm is developed. Specifically, the bisection process in the verification algorithm is completely guided by a given safety specification. Due to the employment of the safety specification, unnecessary computations are avoided and thus the computational cost can be reduced significantly. Experiments show that the proposed method enjoys much more efficiency in safety verification with significantly less computational cost.},

Increasingly, these deep NNs are also been deployed in high-assurance applications. Thus, there is a pressing need for developing techniques to verify neural networks to check whether certain user-expected properties are satisfied. In this paper, we study a specific verification problem of computing a guaranteed range for the output of a deep neural network given a set of inputs represented as a convex polyhedron. Range estimation is a key primitive for verifying deep NNs. We present an efficient range estimation algorithm that uses a combination of local search and linear programming problems to efficiently find the maximum and minimum values taken by the outputs of the NN over the given input set. In contrast to recently proposed "monolithic" optimization approaches, we use local gradient descent to repeatedly find and eliminate local minima of the function. The final global optimum is certified using a mixed integer programming instance. We implement our approach and compare it with Reluplex, a recently proposed solver for deep neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for verification of NNs used in automated control as well as those used in classification.},

Our main contribution is a construction that creates a representation of a binarized neural network as a Boolean formula. Our encoding is the first exact Boolean representation of a deep neural network. Using this encoding, we leverage the power of modern SAT solvers along with a proposed counterexample-guided search procedure to verify various properties of these networks. A particular focus will be on the critical property of robustness to adversarial perturbations. For this property, our experimental results demonstrate that our approach scales to medium-size deep neural networks used in image classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on verifying properties of deep neural networks using an exact Boolean encoding of the network.},

  abstract      = {Deep learning (DL) systems are increasingly deployed in safety- and security-critical domains including self-driving cars and malware detection, where the correctness and predictability of a system's behavior for corner case inputs are of great importance. Existing DL testing depends heavily on manually labeled data and therefore often fails to expose erroneous behaviors for rare inputs. We design, implement, and evaluate DeepXplore, the first whitebox framework for systematically testing real-world DL systems. First, we introduce neuron coverage for systematically measuring the parts of a DL system exercised by test inputs. Next, we leverage multiple DL systems with similar functionality as cross-referencing oracles to avoid manual checking. Finally, we demonstrate how finding inputs for DL systems that both trigger many differential behaviors and achieve high neuron coverage can be represented as a joint optimization problem and solved efficiently using gradient-based search techniques. DeepXplore efficiently finds thousands of incorrect corner case behaviors (e.g., self-driving cars crashing into guard rails and malware masquerading as benign software) in state-of-the-art DL models with thousands of neurons trained on five popular datasets including ImageNet and Udacity self-driving challenge data. For all tested DL models, on average, DeepXplore generated one test input demonstrating incorrect behavior within one second while running only on a commodity laptop. We further show that the test inputs generated by DeepXplore can also be used to retrain the corresponding DL model to improve the model's accuracy by up to 3%.},

  abstract      = {As reinforcement learning agents become increasingly integrated into complex, real-world environments, designing for safety becomes a critical consideration. We specifically focus on researching scenarios where agents can cause undesired side effects while executing a policy on a primary task. Since one can define multiple tasks for a given environment dynamics, there are two important challenges. First, we need to abstract the concept of safety that applies broadly to that environment independent of the specific task being executed. Second, we need a mechanism for the abstracted notion of safety to modulate the actions of agents executing different policies to minimize their side-effects. In this work, we propose Safety Aware Reinforcement Learning (SARL) - a framework where a virtual safe agent modulates the actions of a main reward-based agent to minimize side effects. The safe agent learns a task-independent notion of safety for a given environment. The main agent is then trained with a regularization loss given by the distance between the native action probabilities of the two agents. Since the safe agent effectively abstracts a task-independent notion of safety via its action probabilities, it can be ported to modulate multiple policies solving different tasks within the given environment without further training. We contrast this with solutions that rely on task-specific regularization metrics and test our framework on the SafeLife Suite, based on Conway's Game of Life, comprising a number of complex tasks in dynamic environments. We show that our solution is able to match the performance of solutions that rely on task-specific side-effect penalties on both the primary and safety objectives while additionally providing the benefit of generalizability and portability.},

  abstract      = {In environments with uncertain dynamics exploration is necessary to learn how to perform well. Existing reinforcement learning algorithms provide strong exploration guarantees, but they tend to rely on an ergodicity assumption. The essence of ergodicity is that any state is eventually reachable from any other state by following a suitable policy. This assumption allows for exploration algorithms that operate by simply favoring states that have rarely been visited before. For most physical systems this assumption is impractical as the systems would break before any reasonable exploration has taken place, i.e., most physical systems don't satisfy the ergodicity assumption. In this paper we address the need for safe exploration methods in Markov decision processes. We first propose a general formulation of safety through ergodicity. We show that imposing safety by restricting attention to the resulting set of guaranteed safe policies is NP-hard. We then present an efficient algorithm for guaranteed safe, but potentially suboptimal, exploration. At the core is an optimization formulation in which the constraints restrict attention to a subset of the guaranteed safe policies and the objective favors exploration policies. Our framework is compatible with the majority of previously proposed exploration methods, which rely on an exploration bonus. Our experiments, which include a Martian terrain exploration problem, show that our method is able to explore better than classical exploration methods.},

Although a good model will be accurate most of the time, even the best models are incomplete. This is especially true in Cyber-Physical Systems because high-fidelity physical models of systems are expensive to develop and often intractable to verify. Conversely, reinforcement learning-based controllers are lauded for their flexibility in unmodeled environments, but do not provide guarantees of safe operation. This paper presents an approach for provably safe learning that provides the best of both worlds: the exploration and optimization capabilities of learning along with the safety guarantees of formal verification. Our main insight is that formal verification combined with verified runtime monitoring can ensure the safety of a learning agent. Verification results are preserved whenever learning agents limit exploration within the confounds of verified control choices as long as observed reality comports with the model used for off-line verification. When a model violation is detected, the agent abandons efficiency and instead attempts to learn a control strategy that guides the agent to a modeled portion of the state space. We prove that our approach toward incorporating knowledge about safe control into learning systems preserves safety guarantees, and demonstrate that we retain the empirical performance benefits provided by reinforcement learning. We also explore various points in the design space for these justified speculative controllers in a simple model of adaptive cruise control model for autonomous cars. &lt;/p&gt;},

For non-interpretable ML models, the most commonly used approaches for computing explanations are heuristic in nature. In contrast, recent work proposed rigorous approaches for computing explanations, which hold for a given ML model and prediction over the entire instance space. This paper extends earlier work to the case of boosted trees and assesses the quality of explanations obtained with state-of-the-art heuristic approaches. On most of the datasets considered, and for the vast majority of instances, the explanations obtained with heuristic approaches are shown to be inadequate when the entire instance space is (implicitly) considered.},

But how do we develop a systematic, scalable and modular strategy to validate machine-learning systems? We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach, which provides a systematic test framework for machine-learning systems that accepts grammar-based inputs. Our OGMA approach automatically discovers erroneous behaviours in classifiers and leverages these erroneous behaviours to improve the respective models. OGMA leverages inherent robustness properties present in any well trained machine-learning model to direct test generation and thus, implementing a scalable test generation methodology. To evaluate our OGMA approach, we have tested it on three real world natural language processing (NLP) classifiers. We have found thousands of erroneous behaviours in these systems. We also compare OGMA with a random test generation approach and observe that OGMA is more effective than such random test generation by up to 489%.},

As a result, detecting actual implementation errors can be extremely difficult. We demonstrate a methodology in which developers use an interactive proof assistant to both implement their system and to state a formal theorem defining what it means for their system to be correct. The process of proving this theorem interactively in the proof assistant exposes all implementation errors since any error in the program would cause the proof to fail. As a case study, we implement a new system, Certigrad, for optimizing over stochastic computation graphs, and we generate a formal (i.e. machine-checkable) proof that the gradients sampled by the system are unbiased estimates of the true mathematical gradients. We train a variational autoencoder using Certigrad and find the performance comparable to training the same model in TensorFlow.},

ML is now pervasive---new systems and models are being deployed in every domain imaginable, leading to rapid and widespread deployment of software based inference and decision making. There is growing recognition that ML exposes new vulnerabilities in software systems, yet the technical community's understanding of the nature and extent of these vulnerabilities remains limited. We systematize recent findings on ML security and privacy, focusing on attacks identified on these systems and defenses crafted to date. We articulate a comprehensive threat model for ML, and categorize attacks and defenses within an adversarial framework. Key insights resulting from works both in the ML and security communities are identified and the effectiveness of approaches are related to structural elements of ML algorithms and the data used to train them. We conclude by formally exploring the opposing relationship between model accuracy and resilience to adversarial manipulation. Through these explorations, we show that there are (possibly unavoidable) tensions between model complexity, accuracy, and resilience that must be calibrated for the environments in which they will be used.},

In this paper we discuss one such potential impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning systems, defined as unintended and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems. We present a list of five practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong objective function ("avoiding side effects" and "avoiding reward hacking"), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently ("scalable supervision"), or undesirable behavior during the learning process ("safe exploration" and "distributional shift"). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of AI.},

  year     = {2020},
  abstract = {The problem of mission planning for multiple autonomous agents, including path planning and task scheduling, is often complex. Recent efforts aiming at solving this problem have explored ways of using formal methods to synthesize mission plans that satisfy various requirements. However, when the number of agents grows or requirements include real-time constraints, the complexity of the problem increases to the extent that current algorithmic formal methods cannot handle. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called MCRL, which overcomes this shortcoming by integrating model checking and reinforcement learning techniques. Our approach employs timed automata and timed computation tree logic to describe the autonomous agents' behavior and requirements, and trains the model by a reinforcement learning algorithm, namely Q-learning, to populate a table used to restrict the state space of the model. MCRL combines the ability of model checking to synthesize verifiable mission plans, and the exploration and exploitation capabilities of Q-learning to alleviate the state-space-explosion problem of exhaustive model checking. Our method provides a means to synthesize mission plans for autonomous systems whose complexity exceeds the scalability boundaries of exhaustive model checking, but also to analyze and verify synthesized mission plans in order to ensure given requirements. We evaluate the proposed method on various relevant scenarios involving autonomous agents, and also present and discuss comparisons with other methods and tools.},
